## Super Resolution (FSR)

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) is an open source, high-quality solution for producing high resolution frames from lower resolution inputs.

It uses a collection of cutting-edge algorithms with a particular emphasis on creating high-quality edges, giving large performance improvements compared to rendering at native resolution directly. FSR enables “practical performance” for costly render operations, such as hardware ray tracing.

- ffx-fsr contains the [FSR shader code](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-FSR/tree/master/ffx-fsr)
- sample contains the [FSR sample](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-FSR/tree/master/sample)

You can find the binaries for FidelityFX FSR in the release section on GitHub.
